# Contributing to the CEPC and the Positive Work Environment Community Group

We welcome contributions from the community as we work to develop a positive and inclusive work environment for W3C. 

If you have feedback or questions relating to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct or any of our other projects, please log an issue in this repository. Logging issues allows the chairs to review and raise issues in upcoming meetings. We encourage those who have logged issues to join the meetings, so they can participate in the discussion. You can find meeting information on our [calendar page](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/pwe/calendar).

When logging an issue in this repository: 
* Be as specific as possible in describing the issue and any possible remedies, including supporting documentation 
* If you have multiple topics to address, please open issues for each one individually

We ask that participants do not open Pull Requests with changes to the CEPC or other documents unless asked to do so by the chairs or editors. This is to help us keep discussions in issues or meetings where appropriate.

For any questions relating to contribution or participation in PWE, please reach out to the group at [public-pwe@w3.org](mailto:public-pwe@w3.org).
