# Contributing to the CoC and the Positive Work Environment Community Group

We welcome contributions from the community as we work to develop a positive and inclusive work environment for W3C. 

Before logging any issues, we strongly recommend reviewing our [References and Resources](https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/blob/main/ReferencesAndResources.md), which lists resources we have used to inform our work on this document. 

If you have feedback or questions relating to the Code of Conduct or any of our other projects, please log an issue in this repository. Logging issues allows the chairs to review and raise issues in upcoming meetings. We encourage those who have logged issues to join the meetings, so they can participate in the discussion. You can find meeting information on our [calendar page](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/pwe/calendar).

When logging an issue in this repository: 
* Be as specific as possible in describing the issue and any possible remedies, including supporting documentation 
* If you have multiple topics to address, please open issues for each one individually

We ask that participants not open Pull Requests with changes to the CoC or other documents unless asked to do so by the chairs or editors. This is to help us keep discussions in issues or meetings where appropriate.

## Updating the CoC

In March of each year, the CoC Review Period will open. During this period PWE will work with W3C members, ombudspeople, and the Advisory Board and Advisory Committee to intake and review any issues or recommendations for changes to CoC. This period of review will last 3 months, and should changes be required, PWE will deliver a new version of the CoC to the Advisory Board by the end of July.

This review period does not mean we will not consider issues logged outside of the period. The review period is meant to serve as a time where the group will focus primarily on issues opened before or during that period, in order to give us the ability to focus the rest of our time on other priorities. 

For any questions relating to contribution or participation in PWE, please reach out to the group at [public-pwe@w3.org](mailto:public-pwe@w3.org).
