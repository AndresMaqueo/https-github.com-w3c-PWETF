# Contributing to the CEPC and the Positive Work Environment Community Group

We welcome contributions from the community as we work to develop a positive and inclusive work environment for W3C. 

If you have feedback or questions relating to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct or any of our other projects, please log an issue in this repository. Logging issues allows the chairs to review and raise issues in upcoming meetings. 

We ask that participants do not open Pull Requests with changes to the CEPC or other documents unless asked to do so by the chairs or editors. This is to help us keep discussions in issues or meetings where appropriate, and to help prevent merge conflicts. 

If an issue raises an editorial question or suggestion, the chairs and editors will take care of it in a PR which will then be added to an upcoming meeting agenda for the group to review. 

For any questions relating to contribution or participation in PWE, please reach out to the group at [public-pwe@w3.org](mailto:public-pwe@w3.org).
