    <h1>Positive Work Environment Home Page</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>W3C is a global community where participants choose to work together. In
      that community, we experience differences in language, location,
      nationality,
      and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and
      disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally. </p>
    <p>W3C has developed several resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional
          Conduct (CEPC)</a>, which defines a set of community principles
        regarding how people working in the W3C ecosystem should treat each
        other.</li>
      <li><a href="#Procedures">Procedures</a>, to assist all parties when there
        are issues that arise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also curate a list of <a href="#Education">Education and training</a>
      materials.</p>
    <h2><a name="Procedures" id="Procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These procedures do not substitute for
      intervention by legal authorities. Anyone may seek advice from law
      enforcement
      authorities at any time and should do so immediately if a situation is
      dangerous or potentially so.</p>
    <p>Timely action is encouraged, especially if a behavior rises to the level
      of
      <a href="/Consortium/cepc/#Harassment">harassment</a> or intimidation.</p>
    <div class="alert">
      If one person believes another's behavior is inappropriate (inconsistent
      with
      <a href="/Consortium/cepc/">CEPC</a>), and ordinary communication between
      them is not possible, escalation of the issue takes place by contacting
      one of the <a href="#ombuds">W3C Ombuds</a>, which may be done
      confidentially.</div>
    <p>Any individual in the W3C community —including staff, members, invited
      experts, participants in W3C meetings, in W3C teleconferences, and
      participants
      in mailing lists— may call upon the W3C ombuds for assistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In exceptional circumstances, the W3C Director
      may ban an individual from participating in our activities, e.g. on a
      mailing
      list or in a group (refer to <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies.html#member-rep">section
        3.1.2 of the W3C
        Process Document</a>). </p>
    <h3><a name="ombuds" id="ombuds">Ombuds</a></h3>
    <p>The W3C Ombuds are a small group selected by the W3C management to act as
      trusted confidants to work toward resolving complaints between any
      internal or external constituent. Ombuds will operate by procedures appropriate to
      their sites and jurisdictions. </p>
    <p>The ombuds positions are currently held by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The W3C CEO, </li>
      <li>one person for each W3C Host</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: there is no obligation to contact an Ombuds associated with a
      particular W3C Host, but they may be able to orient complaints to the
      right
      process and next steps more quickly.</p>
    <h3><a id="Current" name="Current">Ombuds list</a></h3>
    <p>The ombuds may be contacted individually or in subset (potentially all of
      them).</p>
