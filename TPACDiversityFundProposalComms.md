# TPAC Diversity Fund Proposal and Comms Plan

May 2020, 
v. 1

## Diversity Fund proposed update 
This goals of this proposal are to:
* increase the diversity of attendees represented at TPAC 
* increase the diversity of attendees who can make meaningful contributions to web standards, at TPAC and beyond
* ease the administrative burden and time pressure of administering the fund

This proposal builds on the previous work and use of the Diversity Fund in 2020.

Increasing representation
To increase the representation at TPAC, W3C should use the diversity fund to run:
* Inclusion Fund: continue the use of the fund to help W3C members to attend, through assistance with technology needs or to reduce the barriers that would prevent them from attending and participating
* TPAC Fellow: a stipend aimed at those from under represented backgrounds who may not have ability to prioritise a meaningful contribution without financial support.

The Inclusion Fund would follow broadly the same structure as the 2020 Fund, with minor amends made to the administrative process, application form and comms.

The TPAC Fellow stipend would be $500, paid to the fellow to prepare and contribute to TPAC in a meaningful way. It is proposed that there be a maximum of 3-5 TPAC fellows.

### Streamlining the administration of the Diversity Fund
There is a significant time pressure to ask for contributions to the fund alongside the need to:
* run the application process for the fund
* assess the applications
* pay the funds in a reasonable time for TPAC

It is suggested, given the balance remaining in the Diversity Fund, that grants be made from existing funds, and requests for donation be made to support the succeeding year’s grants. So for example, the request for donations for this year would contribute to the 2022 fund, while 2021 grants would be supported by 2020 contributions.

This way, the process for applying and distributing the funds can be based on a known quantity of funds for any given year. 

In addition, it is suggested that 3 nominated individuals from the Positive Working Group manage the short listing of candidates for both funds. Decisions on the funds will be made jointly by representatives from the W3C Management and the Positive Working Group (in order to keep the decision-making loop streamlined and prioritised). 

## Inclusion Fund
This fund operates the same as the previous TPAC fund - helping those with particular barriers to attend TPAC. The details of the fund are in the application form introduction  and eligibility section. 

Application form
Introduction

The W3C wants to be a model of supporting greater diversity in technology. Over 50% of the world is online and is growing every year. We want to reflect the diversity of the whole world as more and more people continue to access, use and create the web.

W3C has established a TPAC Diversity Fund, sponsored this year by [sponsors]. W3C uses this fund to help remove barriers for those who want to attend or contribute to TPAC in a meaningful way.

The Inclusion Fund can help pay for:
* technology to participate more effectively online
* help with paying internet costs
* a carer for children or a relative
* noise cancelling headphones if you need quiet to concentrate 
* co-working space if you don’t have room at your office or home

If there are other types of help you think would apply to your situation, you can still apply and explain the reason in your application. 

#### Eligibility
In order to apply for the TPAC Inclusion Fund, you should:
* be from a group that is under-represented in the web community
* unable to participate in TPAC without financial help

The definition of "under-represented" means different things to different people, and may be different depending on where you are. For example, it can include: 
* people with disabilities
* people of color 
* indigenous people
* women
* LGBTQ+ people
* people from outside of Europe and North America
* people from a lower socioeconomic background
* refugees

These examples may be geographically or community-specific, so we encourage anyone who feels they meet the definition of underrepresented that is relevant to their geography or culture to apply for this fund.

You will need a W3C account to submit your application.

If you have questions about your eligibility, or have difficulty using this form, you can send your answers by email to group-diversity@w3.org.

How applications are assessed

The W3C reviewers will prioritise:
* new W3C participants and established participants who have not previously attended TPAC
* diversity among the applications, where that can be determined

Three people from the Positive Working Environment Community Group will short list candidates for both funds. Decisions on the funds will be made jointly by two representatives from the W3C Management and the three members of the Positive Working Environment Community Group.

Your applications won’t be judged on their written quality, in case it’s hard for you to complete, for example if English is your second language or you have a disability.

Information supplied in this form will be submitted to the diversity fund selection committee and stored on W3C's servers and is subject to W3C Privacy Policy.

#### Timeline

The important dates are:
* applications open on 15 June 2021
* applications close on 15 August 2021
* successful applicants notified by 15 September 2021

#### Application

* What communities do you participate in at the W3C?

* What perspectives will you bring to TPAC and what areas would you like to contribute to?

Please provide as much information as you’re comfortable sharing about the under-represented perspectives you would bring to TPAC.

* Are you in any W3C working, interest, or community groups?

* What organization are you from or participating on behalf of?

* What will you use the fund for?
You should also consider any funding from your company or organisation to attend this event. Please include a breakdown of costs.

* Links (Linked In/website)

* Any other information to support your application

## TPAC Fellows Stipend
The goal of the TPAC Fellows Stipend is to support those members of TPAC who may not have the wider support from their organisation to dedicate to W3C goals. 

As W3C wants to increase diversity, it can show that it values diversity and the contribution to W3C to offer a stipend, to pay for the work that members will have to do outside of their work to contribute in a meaningful way.

Meaningful could mean:
* pitching and running a particular session
* preparing documents such as explainers or drafts for discussion
* reviewing a group’s work and preparing comments for discussion

Contributions can be on any topic that is appropriate for TPAC, and don’t specifically have to focus on diversity. The goal of the stipend is to increase representation by those from underrepresented groups in all aspects of the W3C.

### Application form

## Generic comms/TPAC page
W3C believe that more diversity means better representation, which leads to better and more inclusive design. We believe that more background, more use cases, more edge cases, lead to a better Web. More diversity also brings higher quality results. 

The W3C TPAC Inclusion Fund and the new TPAC Fellows Stipend is now open for applications and we encourage you to apply if you feel you are from an underrepresented group and wouldn’t be able to attend or meaningfully contribute to TPAC without financial support.

If there are other types of help you think would be appropriate in your case, you can still apply and explain the reason in your application. 

The TPAC Diversity Fund is sponsored by [sponsors]. If your organisation would like to become a sponsor, contact

## Email to sponsors

Dear Advisory Committee representative, Chairs,

We’d like to draw your attention to the 2021 update of Diversity and Inclusion at W3C and communication on the future of a TPAC Diversity Fund, via a CEO post published on the W3C Blog: [link]

We’re continuing to support the Diversity Fund for 2021, with some changes to ensure  that:
* applications have enough time to apply and receive fund in time for TPAC
* ease the administrative burden and time pressure for managing the fund

We still have [amount] let in the Diversity Fund and so suggest that we run fund retrospectively, for example your sponsorships this year will affect next year’s fund. This will allow us to have a larger time to have applications submitted, scrutinise, decide and pay the successful applications. 

[Details of what the Fund did last year] 

This year, for the W3C has decided for 2020 to contribute [amount].

Sponsors in the past have typically given $1,500 (or equivalent in local currency) and we hope they will continue to do so.

As this year’s TPAC will continue to be virtual, we’re continuing the efforts to ensure that people can attend, for example through assistive technology or caring support. We’re happy to hear ideas on what the fund should support.

We’re also trialling a TPAC Fellow Stipend of $500 to encourage members from underrespresntives groups to contribute in a more meaningful way, such as:
* pitching and running a particular session
* preparing documents such as explainers or drafts for discussion
* reviewing a group’s work and preparing comments for discussion

Contributions can be on any topic that is appropriate for TPAC, and don’t specifically have to focus on diversity. This fund recognises that participating in these events can be time consuming and people from unrepresented backgrounds face struggles within their workplaces and life that may mean they can’t prioritise attendance or a meaningful contribution without financial support.

You can find more details on the application process and eligibility here: [link]

We request that sponsorship commitments be made by 15 August 2021 if possible, so we can announce sponsors for next year at TPAC.

Kind regards
